# Magic Book Quotes

Magic Book Quotes is a web app made using NextJS.

It facilitates the creation of images from book quotes by leveraging the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books)

## Playground

Go to https://magic-book-quotes.vercel.app to try the production environment of this project.

## Run the project

```
npm run dev
```

Then, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to start creating magical quotes!

## How It Works

The application utilizes the Google Books API to fetch essential data, including the book's title, author, and cover image.

This data is then transmitted to the server side.

Here, a canvas is generated and converted into an image, which is subsequently sent back to the client for display.

## Goals

The mantra of this project is "Less is more."

Our aim is to develop a simple app capable of creating images with just a few clicks.

This project's goal is not to address every possible use case, but rather to provide straightforward solutions for the most common ones.
